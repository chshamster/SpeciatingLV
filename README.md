These Matlab codes can be used to generate the figures from 
Random Evolutionary Dynamics in Predator-Prey Systems Yields Large, Clustered Ecosystems.
Authors: Hamster, Schaap, Van Heijster and Dijksman.

The main difference between the codes for Fig. 1 and the other figures is that for Fig. 1, all timesteps are saved, which
is only feasible for short-time simulations.
